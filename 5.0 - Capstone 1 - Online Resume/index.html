			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Hey there! I’m William — a cybersecurity student at Liberty University with a heart for service and a passion for
				protecting others in the digital world. Ever since I heard FBI agents speak at U.S. Cyber Camp, I was hooked. That moment
				set me on a path toward my dream: serving in the FBI’s cybercrime division. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer
				Science with minors in Criminal Justice and Military Operations & Intelligence.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along the way, I’ve had the chance to be part of some amazing clubs and teams—from competing in capture the flag events to
				helping build real-world software applications. I’ve grown just as much from those late-night debugging sessions as I have
				from leading small groups on campus. Whether I’m writing C++ for a programming challenge or mentoring someone through a
				tough week, I show up with integrity, curiosity, and a desire to grow.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of school and cybersecurity, I’m into reading, music, and finding ways to make life (and systems) more
				efficient—both personally and organizationally.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love learning from others, so if you’ve got life or career advice, I’d truly love to hear it. Feel free to send me a
				message!
			</p>
